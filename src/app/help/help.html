        HTTP Rules Engine customizes how our edge servers handle file requests. A rule consists of two main components, which are match options and features. These components define a set of criteria for identifying files and then determining how those files will be handled by our edge servers.

      <p>
        When viewing status information, keep in mind that this field only indicates whether a rule is awaiting approval. Only active rules that are currently enabled will affect how our edge servers handle file requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order in which your rules are listed plays an important part in determining which rule will take precedence when conflicting instructions are given on how to handle a particular file. Rules with general criteria should be placed closer to the top of the list, while more detailed criteria should be placed closer to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The XML data associated with each rule is provided for archival purposes. You can use this information to take a snapshot of your current set of rules or to keep track of the changes made between different rule versions.
